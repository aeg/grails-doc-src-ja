h2. 詳細 {hidden}Description{hidden}

By default services have automatic transaction management such as propagation and so on. By setting @transactional@ to @false@ you disable automatic Spring managed transaction demarcation for every method in the service. When set to the @true@, The propagation level of the transaction is by default set to [PROPAGATION_REQUIRED|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionDefinition.html#PROPAGATION_REQUIRED].

You can also configure services using Spring's [@Transactional|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html] annotation. See [Declarative Transactions|guide:declarativeTransactions] in the user guide for more information.
