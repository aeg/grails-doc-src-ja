h2. 詳細 {hidden}Description{hidden}

Some projects, particular plugins, benefit from documentation explaining how they work. Grails comes with its own [documentation engine|guide:docengine] based on a wiki syntax that can generate both HTML and PDF versions of a user guide, just like the one you are currently reading. If you have the source for a user guide in @src/docs@, then this command will automatically generate the corresponding HTML and PDF documents.

It's often useful to have API documentation as well. Since Grails is a mixed source framework, the command also generates both [Javadoc|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html] (the standard format for Java documentation) and Groovydoc API references in HTML form.

The documentation is generated to the following directories:

* @docs/api@ - Location of javadoc comments
* @docs/gapi@ - Location of groovydoc comments
* @docs/guide@ - Location of the user guide
* @docs/ref@ - Location of the reference section of the user guide
